# Certificate Transparency Browser Extension on Prism

*Empowering Secure Web Browsing with Blockchain-Powered Certificate Verification*

**Certificate Transparency Browser Extension on Prism** is an innovative Chrome and Firefox extension that enhances web security by integrating Certificate Transparency (CT) with Prism on the Celestia blockchain. This extension verifies SSL/TLS certificates in real time, detects and prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, and sets a new standard for transparent, tamper-proof certificate validation, ensuring a safer HTTPS experience for users.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Advanced Security**: Combines Certificate Transparency (CT) logs with Prism on the Celestia blockchain for decentralized, immutable certificate verification, protecting users from sophisticated MitM attacks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A sleek, intuitive popup delivers real-time verification results with a single click.
- **Scalable Blockchain Technology**: Leverages Rust, WebAssembly, and Lumina light nodes for high performance and decentralized verification.
- **Hackathon Innovation**: A groundbreaking solution for secure web browsing, addressing real-world security challenges in the digital age.
